•What is a 'fully digital enterprise'? <br> A digital Enterprise is a business that has completed a digitalization strategy (aka, digital transformation) to fully incorporate digital Tools
and technologies across all aspects of their operations, from ideation thru realization to utilization.

<br>
<br>

<br>•What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise? <br>
- Data breaches
<br> - Ransomware
<br> - Phishing
<br> - Cloud Security

<br>
<br>
•What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a
digital enterprise?
<br> - Lack of Knowledge and Expertise- As a company moves more of its operations online, its employees may need to develop new skills and knowledge to maintain security. 
This could include areas such as cloud security, network security, and incident response.
<br> - Limited Resources-  SMEs often have limited budgets and personnel, which can make it difficult to implement and maintain robust security measures. 
This may include everything from firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, to incident response plans and threat intelligence,
<br> - Complex Systems and Integration-  as a company expands its use of digital systems and technologies, it can become more difficult to secure all its assets and to understand where the vulnerabilities and risks might lie. 
Additionally, all systems need to be integrated and aligned, which can be challenging and costly.
<br> - Data Governance- As more data is collected, stored, and processed digitally, SMEs must ensure that they comply with data protection regulations and keep their data safe. 
This includes protecting customer and employee data, as well as dealing with data breaches in a timely manner

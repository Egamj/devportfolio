      <br>  
      
      A) IoT Infrastructure What would be a typical IoT infrastructure setup for our greenhouses? 
      <br>- Sensors: These would be placed throughout the greenhouse to collect data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light levels, and other environmental factors.
      <br>- Gateway: This would be the hub that connects the sensors to the network and the cloud. It may include a microcontroller or single board computer to process data from sensors and control devices such as actuators, fans or other devices.
      <br>- Network: This would be used to connect the gateway and sensors to the internet and/or the cloud. It may include a combination of wired and wireless connections, such as WiFi or cellular networks.
      <br>- Cloud platform: This would be used to store, analyze, and visualize the data collected by the sensors, and to control the devices. It may include cloud services such as AWS IoT, Azure IoT or GCP IoT platform.
      <br>- User interface: This would be the front end that allows the growers to monitor, control and program the greenhouse. It can be a web or mobile application, that provides graphical representation of the data, and allows farmers to adjust the conditions and settings accordingly.
      <br>
      <br>All of these components together create a holistic ecosystem that connects all the device and systems together, allowing the farmers to monitor, control and optimize the growing conditions in real-time, resulting in better yields, lower costs and higher quality produce
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <br>B) Constraints, What are some constraints we may be dealing with within our greenhouse
      operation? 
      <br>- Limited connectivity: Greenhouses may be located in remote areas where internet connectivity is limited, or where wired connections are impractical. This can make it difficult to transmit data from the greenhouse to the cloud, and to control devices remotely.
      <br>- Extreme temperatures: Greenhouse temperatures can vary greatly from day to night, and from summer to winter. The IoT devices, gateway, and other equipment need to be designed and rated to withstand these temperature fluctuations without malfunctioning.
      <br>- High humidity levels: High humidity levels within a greenhouse can cause damage to electronic devices, and can also contribute to condensation and mold inside the equipment. This could require moisture protection and control of the equipment.
      <br>- Power limitations: Greenhouses may not have a reliable power source, making it difficult to maintain a stable power supply for the IoT devices. This might require battery backup systems, or other power management solutions.
      <br>- Environmental factors: Greenhouses may be exposed to environmental factors such as dust, pests, and extreme weather conditions, which could damage the sensors, gateways, and other devices. This might require additional protective measures, such as enclosure, to the equipment.
      <br>- Data governance: Greenhouse IoT infrastructure will collect and store a large amount of data. It's essential to ensure that the data is stored and processed securely, and that it's compliant with relevant data protection regulations.
      <br>- Maintenance: As the equipment is exposed to harsh environment, the IoT infrastructure will require more maintenance than a typical office or industrial setup. The equipment, sensors, and gateways will require more cleaning, replacement and repairs to keep them running effectively.
      <br>- Scalability: As the infrastructure grow it may not be able to handle the amount of data and devices, or may require additional resources such as memory or processing power. It's important to plan for scalability from the beginning, to avoid costly upgrades in the future.
